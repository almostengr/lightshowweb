The Rasberry Pi controls the relays, which in turn controls all of the lights. The Pi controls each of the 24 channels of relays via the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Christmas Lights All of the lights are LED. Only two colors are used for the light show, white and red. Relays All of the relays are Solid State Relays (SSR). SSRs were used because they have no mechanical or moving parts and having greater reliability for being switched on and off frequently. Mechanical relays heat up from switching on an off. When done repeatedly, like during a song, the relay can actually over heat and self-destruct. FM Transmission Music is transmitted over radio via a low-power FM transmitter. Music goes into the transmitter directly from the Raspberry Pi and broadcasted on an open frequency. Radio Locator in Other Resources was used to locate the best frequency. Software Xlights The music and light sequences are timed together using Xlights. This software is open source and runs on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. Falcon Pi Player (FPP) Once the sequences have been created in Xlights, those files are copied over to FPP. From there, the show data files, music files, and scheduling are all connected within this software. Kdenlive Kdenlive is a video editing tool. It can also be used to modify audio files. The show intro audio file was modified with Kdenlive to have the voice over and background music on the same track. Pictures Coming soon. Videos Coming soon.

Each connection that is on the ground is wrapped in electrical tape. That prevents water from reaching the connections, which would result in an electrical short, thus tripping the breaker and shutting down the show. How much does the show raise your power bill? Not sure. This is the first year doing an animated display, so there's no comparison from previous years. An update will be provided on this at a later time. What have you done in previous years?
