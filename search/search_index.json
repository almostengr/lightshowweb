Those updates include posting the current song and providing alerts when problems are detected. This application is ONLY designed to run on Falcon Pi Players that are installed on Raspberry Pi. How Does It Work Tweeting Song Information This application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the meta data for the song that is current playing. Then it uses that information to compose a tweet. If the song that is playing does not have ID3 tag information entered, then will not display part or all of the song data. If you need to add the song meta data to the file, you can use a program like Audacity to do so. Tweeting Temperature Alerts The application calls the Falcon Pi Player API to get the current temperature of the Raspberry Pi. If it is above the threshold that is specified in the appsettings.json file, then it will send a tweet that mentions the users specified in the appsettings.json file a message to let them know if the current temperature. When the temperature drops below the threshold, then another tweet is sent. Source Code Source code for this project is hosted on Github . Installation Instructions Download the latest release that is available in zip or tar format. Copy the archive file to your Raspberry Pi. Extract the archive file contents. Ideally extract them to a folder in the /home/fpp directory. Create a Twitter Developer account . Once approved, create a project. Within that project, create Consumer Key (aka API Key), Consumer Secret (aka API Secret), Access Token and Access Secret. Also within that project, update the App Permissions to \"Read and Write\". By default, permissions are \"Read\". Copy appsettings.template.json to appsettings.json. Add the key, secrets, and token that you got from your Twitter developer account to the appsettings.json file. See Example appsettings.json File and About appsettings.json File for explainations and details. Create a cronjob that will run the automation on startup. See Creating Cronjob for explaination. Reboot your Raspberry Pi Once the Pi has come back online, check the log file to confirm that the monitor has started. You should see output similar to the below at the beginning of the log file. Starting service. Exit program by pressing Ctrl+C Connected to Twitter as hpchristmas The \"Connected to Twitter\" message in the log file, confirms that your account has been properly configured and can post to Twitter. Creating Cronjob Create a cronjob that runs on reboot. On your FPP, open a SSH session. Once logged in, enter crontab -e When the text editor opens, add the following to the bottom of the file. Change the directory to match where you extracted the FP Monitor. @reboot /home/fpp/fpmonitor/falconpimonitor > /home/fpp/media/logs/falconpimonitor.log 2>&1 Then save and exit the text editor. Example appsettings.json File Once you have added the Twitter key, token, and secrets to the appsettings.json file, it should look like the following: { \"Logging\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\", \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\", \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\" } }, \"TwitterSettings\": { \"ConsumerKey\": \"8W4tZQ6xp7\", \"ConsumerSecret\": \"qJz6nDw2T7\", \"AccessToken\": \"KBiEB6jn28\", \"AccessSecret\": \"8nftJzHOAI\", }, \"AlarmSettings\": { \"TwitterUser\": \"@XrGOEz2Wc7\", \"TempThreshold\": 55.0 }, \"FppMonitorSettings\":{ \"PostOffline\": false, \"RefreshInterval\": 15 }, \"FalconPiPlayerSettings\":{ \"FalconUri\": \"http://falconpi/\" } } About appsettings.json File \"TwitterUser\" should be the name of the Twitter account that can be mentioned if there is an issue with the show (e.g. Raspberry Pi having high CPU temperature). Value needs to include the at (@) symbol. \"FalconUri\" should be the hostname or IP address to your Falcon Pi Player. If your FPP does not have an assigned or static IP address, then it is recommended to use the hostname. \"TempThreshold\" should be the threshold that has to be reached before a high temperature alert is triggered. In warmer climates, you will want to set this value higher to prevent false alerts. This value needs to be in degrees Celsius. Per the Raspberry Pi documentation, 60 to 65 degrees Celsius is close to the safe upper operating limit of the Pi.

Known Bugs Exception on First Run An exception will occur in the log if the Wifi connection has not been established before the first run. Confirm in the log that HttpRequestException is not repeating in the logs after 2 or 3 attempts. Duplicate Log Entries Log entries are duplicated after project refactoring.

Each connection that is on the ground is wrapped in electrical tape. That prevents water from reaching the connections, which would result in an electrical short, thus tripping the breaker and shutting down the show. Outlets and plugs that are not on the ground, are pointed downwards so that water cannot enter the socket, which would result in a short. How much does it cost to run the light show? Your electric bill must be high! Since LEDs are used for the light show, it is not high at all. To run the show for 5 weeks, with all the lights on would cost $38.90. Given that all the lights are not all the entire time and the equipment is not running at max capacity (which hardly ever happens), the actual cost is less than this. See Do The Math for the breakout and how this cost was derived. Do The Math With all lights turned on (2130 LEDs were used for the 2020 Light Show), it pulls 130 Watts. The show controller and components can pull a maximum of 305 Watts. Thus the show in total can use 435 (130 + 305) Watts maximum. The lights run for 33.5 hours per week (Sunday through Thursday, 4.5 hours; Friday and Saturday, 5.5 hours). The show runs for 5 weeks during the Christmas season. The controller runs 168 hours per week (24 hours per day). Electric companies measure the amount of electricity that you use in kilowatt-hours. To convert W (Watts) to kWh (kilowatt-hours), you have to compute the lights and controller separately since they are on for different durations. E(kWh lights) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 130 Watts * 33.5 hours / 1000 = 4.355 kWh E(kWh controller) = P(W) \u00d7 t(hr) / 1000 = 435 Watts * 168 hours / 1000 = 73.08 kWh The rate for electricity during the winter months (Oct-May) is $0.100511 per kWh. Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44 Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34 That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is Christmas season would be $7.78 or $38.90 for the entire season. Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount.

The Rasberry Pi controls the relays, which in turn controls all of the lights. The Pi controls each of the 24 channels of relays via the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Christmas Lights All of the lights are LED. Only two colors are used for the light show, white and red. Solid State Relays All of the relays are Solid State Relays (SSR). SSRs were used because they have no mechanical or moving parts and having greater reliability for being switched on and off frequently. Mechanical relays heat up from switching on an off. When done repeatedly, like during a song, the relay can actually over heat, self-destruct, or weld itself closed. FM Radio Transmission Music is transmitted over radio via a low-power FM transmitter. Music goes into the transmitter directly from the Raspberry Pi and broadcasted on an open frequency. Radio Locator in the Resources was used to locate the best frequency. Software Xlights The music and light sequences are timed together using Xlights. This software is open source and runs on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. Falcon Pi Player (FPP) Once the sequences have been created in Xlights, those files are copied over to FPP. From there, the show data files, music files, and scheduling are all connected within this software. Kdenlive Kdenlive is a video editing tool. It can also be used to modify audio files.
