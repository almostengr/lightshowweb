That prevents water from reaching the connections, which would result in an electrical short, thus tripping the breaker and shutting down the show.</p> <p>Outlets and plugs that are not on the ground, are pointed downwards so that water cannot enter the socket, which would result in a short.</p> <h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-run-the-light-show-your-electric-bill-must-be-high>How much does it cost to run the light show? Your electric bill must be high!</h2> <p>Since LEDs are used for the light show, it is not high at all. To run the show for 5 weeks, with all the lights on would cost $38.90. Given that all the lights are not all the entire time and the equipment is not running at max capacity (which hardly ever happens), the actual cost is less than this.</p> <p>See <a href=#do-the-math>Do The Math</a> for the breakout and how this cost was derived.</p> <h3 id=do-the-math>Do The Math</h3> <p>With all lights turned on (2130 LEDs were used for the 2020 Light Show), it pulls 130 Watts. The show controller and components can pull a maximum of 305 Watts. Thus the show in total can use 435 (130 + 305) Watts maximum.</p> <p>The lights run for 33.5 hours per week (Sunday through Thursday, 4.5 hours; Friday and Saturday, 5.5 hours). The show runs for 5 weeks during the Christmas season. The controller runs 168 hours per week (24 hours per day).</p> <p>Electric companies measure the amount of electricity that you use in kilowatt-hours. To convert W (Watts) to kWh (kilowatt-hours), you have to compute the lights and controller separately since they are on for different durations.</p> <pre><code class=language-shell>E(kWh lights) = P(W) × t(hr) / 1000 = 130 Watts * 33.5 hours / 1000 = 4.355 kWh

E(kWh controller) = P(W) × t(hr) / 1000 = 435 Watts * 168 hours / 1000 = 73.08 kWh
</code></pre> <p>The rate for electricity during the winter months (Oct-May) is $0.100511 per kWh.</p> <pre><code class=language-shell>Cost for lights = 0.100511 * 4.355 kWh = 0.44

Cost for controller = 0.100511 * 73.08 kWh = 7.34
</code></pre> <p>That means the maximum total cost of the show per week is Christmas season would be $7.78 or $38.90 for the entire season.</p> <p>Now given that the light show does not have all of the lights on at any given point during the show and the controller is not running at maximum capacity all of the time, the actual cost is less than the above mentioned amount.</p> <h2 id=what-have-you-done-in-previous-years>What have you done in previous years?</h2> <p>Use the navigation on the left to see the information about the displays from previous years.</p> <h2 id=you-built-a-control-box-for-your-show-how-much-did-that-cost>You built a control box for your show.
