# 2019 Christmas Light Show

## Hardware

### Christmas Lights

All of the lights are LED. Only two colors are used for the light show. White and red.

### Timer

All of the lights were connected to a single timer. That timer was set to run from about 5:00 PM until 
10:30 PM each evening.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### How do you keep the lights from shorting out in the rain?

Each connection that is in contact with the ground is wrapped in electrical tape. That prevents water from 
coming in contact with the outlet, which would result in an electrical short and tripping the breaker.
